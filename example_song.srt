00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Intro - Instrumental]

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,500
In the beginning there was darkness

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
And then came the light (the light, the light)

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Across the cosmos we're wandering

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Through the eternal night (eternal night)

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Stars are calling out our names (calling, calling)

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Dancing in the void

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,500
We are stardust, we are flame (we are flame)

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,000
Nothing can be destroyed

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,500
[Chorus] Take me to the universe

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Where the galaxies collide (collide, collide)

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Show me all the wonders first

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,000
In this cosmic ride (cosmic ride)

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,500
We are infinite and free (infinite)

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,000
Floating through space and time

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,500
This is our destiny (destiny)

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,000
To reach the sublime

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,500
[Bridge - Instrumental break]

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,000
Beyond the edge of reason (beyond, beyond)

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We'll find our way back home

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
[Final Chorus] Take me to the universe

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Where the galaxies collide

23
