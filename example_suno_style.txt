[Cosmic Progressive Trance]

Uplifting, transcendent electronic dance music celebrating humanity's place in the cosmos. Ethereal synths with a Carl Sagan-inspired philosophical bent. Think progressive trance meets space ambient - something that would feel at home on the Voyager Golden Record. Driving 4/4 beat with cosmic atmospheres, building from contemplative to euphoric. The sound should evoke the vastness of space, the wonder of existence, and the joy of being conscious stardust.

Style references: Above & Beyond's contemplative moments, vintage Kraftwerk's space themes, Brian Eno's ambient textures, with a modern festival-ready energy. Lush pads, soaring leads, and a sense of infinite possibility.
